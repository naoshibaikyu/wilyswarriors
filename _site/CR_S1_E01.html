<strong>LOCATION:</strong> Robotropolis</p>

<p>Narrator: In a not too distant future, lies ruins of a familiar lab. …Er, wait is that Dr. Light’s lab? What happened?! WHAT? [flips through the script] B-but it’s not 21XX! How long was I on vacation?! I thought it was 4 years!!</p>

<p>[A piece of rubble rolls off as the pile under it shakes]</p>

<p>Narrator: <em>gasp</em> What’s this? A survivor? Can it be…?</p>

<p>[A hand sprouts of it and the Narrator screams as he gets pulled in by it, disappearing into the rubble]</p>

<p>Narrator: [in the rubble] HELP ME THEY’RE GONNA EAT ME OFAJSGK;SJHLKSAGFLSHDGL;SFAGDKNDG;FKSDGASF AUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>

<p>HornetShocked: [pops out of the ground with him] What the fuck, stop fucking screaming!! What the FUCK were you doing?!</p>

<p>Narrator: Uh I-</p>

<p>HornetShocked: YOU WERE SUPPOSE TO PULL ME OUT OF IT. NOT DRAG YOURSELF INTO THE PIT WITH ME LIKE I’M SOME KIND OF ZOMBIE PULLING YOU IN.</p>

<p>Narrator: Sorry, I just wanted a dramatic scene.</p>

<p>HornetShocked: I WAS LOSING AIR, ASSHOLE. DON’T YOU EVER PUT YOUR NEED FOR DRAMATIC NARRATION OVER MY LIFE EVER AGAIN.</p>

<p>Narrator: Wait, but aren’t you a robot? How can you breath-</p>

<p>HornetShocked: WE’RE CYBORGS.</p>

<p>Narrator: Oh. Well back to my narrating post! <strong><em>[whooosh]</em></strong></p>

<p>HornetGlare: …</p>

<p>Magma: [blasts out of a pile of rubble and climbs out] Hoyyyyy, that was a killer party. What even happened and where are the others?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Beats me!!! I can’t even remember, my head fuckin hurts. As does my body. Holy shit. EVERYTHING HURTS. FUCK. AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.</p>

<p>Magma: Same</p>

<p>GalaxyAngry: [flying into the scene in UFO mode] WHAT THE HELL?! I told you all to not mess with the generator!!! Now everything is gone!!</p>

<p>Magma: What generator?</p>

<p>GalaxyAngry: The galactic portal one!</p>

<p>HornetAngry: I STILL DON’T REMEMBER. FUCK.</p>

<p>GalaxyPissed: Chill!!!</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: You’re the one that jumped right to the conclusion we blew up Dr. Light’s lab!!</p>

<p>Galaxy: Ok. Fair Point.</p>

<p>HornetAngry: YEAH! COULD’VE BEEN YOUR DUMBASS THAT DID IT FOR WHAT WE ALL KNOW!</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Galaxy: Hey! Do you sense that?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: No.</p>

<p>Magma: Ya.</p>

<p>Hornet: You do??</p>

<p>Magma: Yeah! The atmosphere suddenly feels so boring, lazy and completely aloof all of a sudden…</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: It must be our leader. Save him!</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Okay, we just gotta find the source of the boredom we’re suddenly feeling.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: That doesn’t make sense!</p>

<p>Magma: Of course it does! Concrete emits boredom through his face, so the more you feel the aloofness, the closer he is.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Since when can he even do t-</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Let’s find him!</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: Yeah. [flies around the remains of the lab on near ground level]</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Well, whatever. I’m not moving from this spot.</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: [on one side] I’m not even sensing it much here…</p>

<p>Galaxy: [on the other side] Me neither.</p>

<p>Hornet: [staying on the same exact spot] Me three.</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: That’s because ya sitting there like a dolt. Move already and help!</p>

<p>HornetGlare: No.</p>

<p>Galaxy: [on the center] Close… But still not there.</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: [at around the entrance’s remains] Nothing here either.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: [still on the same exact spot] Meh. Still nothing.</p>

<p>GalaxyAngry: Dude, come on.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: I’m too lazy to really care and my headache is getting worse. I don’t even feel like screaming or swearing anymore.</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: …</p>

<p>Galaxy: Huh?</p>

<p>HornetGlare: I’m gonna take a na-</p>

<p>MagmaAngry: [shoves Hornet to the side and blasts a hole where he was sitting]</p>

<p>HornetGlare: What the heck????</p>

<p>MagmaHappy: [pulls Concrete Man right out of the spot] Found him!</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: <img src="assets/images/misc/concrete.png" alt="" /> [stops emitting the boredom signal]</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: Good.</p>

<p>HornetAngry: Tell me to move next time asshole!</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: You wouldn’t have moved even if I told you.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: Piss off. My gigantic headache is finally clearing and you’re still a pain!</p>

<p>GalaxyAnnoyed: Man, you must’ve been stuck with Concrete for hours.</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: <img src="assets/images/misc/concrete.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>MagmaHappy: Right. We still need to find the others!</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: So that’s 4 of us, so 3 more to go.</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Wait, I thought there were nine of us!</p>

<p>Galaxy: Jewel Woman told us she went on a mission, remember? And Tornado just went AWOL for days.</p>

<p>HornetGlare: We just told you we can’t remember shit!</p>

<p>GalaxyAnnoyed: Screw you. I still have my memory tact because I went shopping before you blew up the place!</p>

<p>HornetAngry: WE DIDN’T DO IT!!!</p>

<p>GalaxyAnnoyed: How would you know? You’ve lost your memory!</p>

<p>HornetShocked: I DON’T HAVE AMNESIA. I JUST DON’T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PARTY.</p>

<p>GalaxyHappy: #SelectiveAmnesia ┐(￣∀￣)┌</p>

<p>HornetShocked: OH YEAH WELL FUCK YOU! ALL YOU EVER DID WAS JERK OFF IN THE STORE OR SOMETHIN’</p>

<p>GalaxyAnnoyed: …What? (￣□￣」)</p>

<p>HornetAngry: YEAH, GOTCHA THERE DIDN’T I?</p>

<p>MagmaAnnoyed: Uh…</p>

<p>Hornet: Yea?</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: <img src="assets/images/misc/concrete.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hornet: Fuck off.</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: <img src="assets/images/misc/concreteright.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>HornetAngry: You’re giving me a headache again!!</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: <img src="assets/images/misc/concretedownright.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hornet: Leave me alone!!!</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: <img src="assets/images/misc/concreteupsidedown.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>HornetShocked: FUCKING STOP</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: <img src="assets/images/misc/concretespin1.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>HornetPissed: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>

<p>SpikeAloof: <img src="assets/images/misc/concretespin2.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>HornetPissed:</p>
