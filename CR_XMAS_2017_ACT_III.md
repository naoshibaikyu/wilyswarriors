MagmaAngry: **RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!**

<div class="narration">
Magma Man shouts loudly as he digs through planet from the very bottom towards the top. Eventually he meets the center of the planet; its core.
</div>

MagmaAngry: **RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!** [gets engulfed in the molten magma of the core]

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>The North Pole</div>

SantaSad: Ho ho ho...

Elf: What's wrong, Santa?

SantaSad: Christmas just isn't the same anymore, Jimmy... Just not the same...

Elf: But we do the same thing every year?

Santa: Exactly! And how long have we've been doing it? For centuries! We need something new... something... fresh. Something that would make it exciting for me again!

Elf: Like what?

SantaThinking: [sighs and sits back on his rocking chair] Like... Hmm...

<div class="narration">
Suddenly, the North Pole begins to shake as if there's an earthquake!
</div>

ElfShocked: WH-WHAT THE?!

SantaShocked: An earthquake?! Here?! In the North Pole?!

GhostPresentAnnoyed: Anyways...!! Uhh... You're in the present now.

Hornet: ...

GhostPresentHappy: ...

HornetGlare: And?

GhostPresentScared: We're just really standing here. And that is what's going on in the present. Now I've hope you've learned your valuable lesson and become an upstanding citizen!

HornetAngry: The only valuable lesson I've learned is that you're an insufferable idiot prick. GET LOST!

GhostPresentShocked: EEP!! W-well... uh...! Bye!

<div class="narration">
GhostPresent Man dashes out of the room.
</div>

Hornet: [deep sigh and rests]

SplashAnnoyed: ...

GhostPresent: S-sorry, mon ami. I couldn't do it! He was just too immitating to handle...

FakeAnnoyed: Why couldn't you let Galaxy Man handle that one?

GalaxyHappy: Oh! Don't worry, I've got a great idea as the next ghost!

GhostPresentHappy: Oh! Do tell!

Galaxy: Well, we can't let the readers know! [faces to the reader] Why don't you tune in to the other scene first?

FakeShocked: Readers??

<div class="narration"><b>LOCATION: </b>The North Pole</div>

SantaShocked: What in god's name is an earthquake doing around here?!

ElfShocked: What is that screaming?!

MagmaAngry: **RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!**

<div class="narration">
Magma Man finally reaches to the surface of the North Pole. He pops out of the hole he just created several yards away from Santa's Workshop as a lava geyser spews out of the hole. As soon as he lands, he strikes a pose!
</div>

SantaShocked: HO HO HOLY SHIT!!

Elf: [holds up a "10" card]

Santa: [holds up a "11" card]

SpikeAloof: [holds up a blank card] ...

MagmaAnnoyed: ...[shoots his magma bazooka at Concrete Man]

SpikeAloof: [blows up]

MagmaGiddy: SANTAAAAA!!

SantaHappy: BILLY!!!!

MagmaAngry: My name is not Billy!!!

SantaSad: Sorry

MagmaHappy: Anyways, ol' Nick! I've came literally all the way from the other side of the planet to ask for a certain job position.

Santa: A job position?

Magma: Yeah, like a PR!

SantaThinking: Hmmm... Well, we don't have any job listings for a PR.

MagmaSad: Aw...

Santa: However! I think there are changes needed are in order... You can only do so much with doing the same thing after so many centuries, after all...

Magma: Oh?

SantaSad: Yeah! In fact... Christmas is hardly my holiday anymore. It used to be all about giving the gifts of joy to children and family everywhere...

SantaAngry: But now it's just an excuse for the commercialized industry to make 20x more money! I hardly get to make my own gifts to children anymore. We've gotta reclaim what was rightfully mine!

MagmaGiddy: [fist pump] Yeah! LET'S RECLAIM IT AND RENAME IT TO SINIMAS!

SantaShocked: Sinimas?!

MagmaHappy: Ya.

SantaThinking: Sounds threatening... They would have a hard time taking our holiday away from us again! I'll allow it!

ElfShocked: Are you sure you really want to do this?!

MagmaGiddy: HECK YEA!!

Santa: I don't see why not.

MagmaAngry: BEWARE COWARDS. WE ARE SINIMAS.
