## Act I

Narrator: We find ourselves currently overseeing the machinations of Concrete Man within the confines of the team's base! Concrete Man who is... ...just... ...standing there.. ...doing absolutely.. ...nothing interesting.

SpikeAloof: . . .

%Concrete Man's head dips forwards, then seemingly rolls off of his shoulders! The helmet upon his head hits the ground and rolls forwards, revealing two little feet underneath. It's a mettaur! The mettaur hisses and scurries away while Concrete Man's body falls backwards with a loud THUD.

Narrator: After some time, eventually the team discovers Concrete Man's empty husk...

HornetShocked: ...WH-WHAT THE FUCK!?

FakeAnnoyed: Hornet Man, what are you yelling about this time?

HornetShocked: WHAT. THE FUCK.

%Fakette strolls over and follows Hornet Man's gaze... upon seeing Concrete Man's headless body, she recoils.

FakeShocked: Oh. OH.

Magma: WHAT ARE WE YELLING ABOUT?

%Magma Man enters the room shortly after Fakette, and stares down in disbelief.

MagmaShocked: Oh.

HornetShocked: . . .

FakeShocked: . . .

MagmaAnnoyed: WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A MURDER MYSTERY AFOOT!

%Tornado Man and Splash Man both enter the room, having been drawn to the others by their shouting. Splash Man's gaze darts about the room, as if he were trying to ascertain where a possible hidden assailant would have struck from. Tornado Man, on the other hand, simply gazed forwards, as if deep within the throes of some intense mental gymnastics.

SplashShocked: H-how could this treachery have gotten past a ninja such as myself!? This is most disgraceful.. Hmm..

%Splash Man raises his hand and pounds his fist into his flattened palm, with a look of determination he proclaims to the others his intentions.

SplashAngry: I will assist in investigations in whatever way I can!

HornetSad: . . .Hmm. .

%Tornado Man, meanwhile, had walked over to the body and stared down at it.

TornadoShocked: . . .

%Tornado Man shakes his head and holds up his hand to indicate to the others he was speaking.

TornadoSad: Investigation start beginning. Best information make gather.

%Jewel Woman strides into the room shortly after Tornado Man begins his statement, having heard the shouting of Magma Man earlier. She glances from each person in turn before her gaze settles upon the headless body.

JewelShocked: What are you all up t--...

MagmaGiddy: YOU HEAR THAT? WE'RE GOING TO BE INVESTIGATING! I'M ON THE CASE!

JewelAnnoyed: Hearing you was originally the reason why I came here.

FakeHappy: I'M going to be investigating. YOU'RE going to be helping ME!

MagmaAnnoyed: No! You're going to have the honor of helping me!

%As the others bicker, Tornado Man rests his hand upon his chin in further silent contemplation.

TornadoAnnoyed: . . .

%Tornado Man shakes his head and glances down near the body. He circles around the body once before he starts to walk away with his gaze glued firmly to the ground.. Jewel Woman watches as Tornado Man walks off before she draws her gaze to Fakette and Magma Man's bickering. Splash Man glances between Tornado Man and the group before he opts to follow Tornado Man.

HornetSad: . . .Hmmmm...

FakeAnnoyed: Well, you know what they say! Every dog has his day! And today just isn't yours! So you're gonna help me!

MagmaAngry: I'M A PRIVATE EYE! I WORK ALONE! THAT'S HOW IT WORKS!

FakeAngry: A private seeing eye -- dog! Police dog!

MagmaAngry: I'LL CRACK THIS CASE ON MY OWN!!

%Hornet Man finally speaks up after he crosses his arms. His tone is very matter-of-fact, yet tinged with some lingering malice.

HornetAnnoyed: It was Galaxy Man.

MagmaShocked: Huh?

FakeShocked: What?

JewelShocked: How can you be so certain it was Galaxy Man?

Hornet: Plug Man doesn't seem the type and the rest of you are right here. 

FakeAnnoyed: I don't know about that... You were the one I saw here first!

%Hornet Man balls his hands into fists, his eyes narrowing in frustration as he silently grit his teeth.

HornetAnnoyed: . . .

Jewel: Out of everyone here, you are the most suspect, Hornet Man.

HornetAnnoyed: WHAT? No. It's obviously Galaxy Man. He's not even here!

Jewel: Not only were you here before everyone else according to Fake, but you were also the first to name a suspect without any assistance in looking for the perpetrator.

%Hornet Man angrily jabs his hand forwards, pointing in Jewel Woman's direction.

HornetAngry: I DIDN'T DO IT, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING!

MagmaAnnoyed: ...Hmmm... ..They have a point. You were the one here first!

%As the three bicker, on the other side of the base, Splash Man followed along after Tornado Man, the latter of whom was explaining his investigative process in earnest.

Tornado: ...Addition information. Make check of surrounding finding evidence. When finding evidence trail get, observation sight. Determine type evidence get, follow notes acquirement. Movement current recognition of evidence. Others require assist courtesy of self.

%Splash Man nods, having understood Tornado Man's musings.

Splash: That is not quite unlike my methods of tracking.

TornadoHappy: Of profession, investigative and ninja divergent unlike.

%Splash Man brings his hand to his chin in thought.

Splash: No, I would suppose they aren't too dissimilar..

%Tornado Man nods, then points to the ground near the door that led outside.

Tornado: Sight seeing of trail. Evidence movement of perpetrator of making crime. Noticed first grime dirt on Concrete neckplate.

Splash: This means our enemy assassin came from the outside, does it not?

Tornado: Un-believe assassin.

SplashShocked: And what is it do you believe to have happened?

Tornado: Of believe Concrete self left own self.

%Splash Man lowers his hand and slowly draws his gaze to Tornado Man, as if silently asking a question. Tornado Man nods solemnly before he points over towards the door handle.

Tornado: Note making of handledoor. Seeing sight of grime lacking.

%Tornado Man then pointed down, towards the corner of the door, where there was a decent amount of dirt and grime.

TornadoHappy: Trail evidence lead onward. Further making trail follow going.

%Splash Man's eyes narrow slightly in a further question, however he follows after Tornado Man once he uses his foot to open the door. Once outside, Tornado Man motions towards what appeared to be the tracks of a turtle.

Tornado: See trail leading of evidence. Direction point to Concrete.

%Splash Man's gaze draws itself to the ground, and he follows the trail with Tornado Man in close pursuit.

Splash: Ah! The path diverges here. The deeper ruts in the ground show it's a more-traveled path. The shallower ones would be less traveled. Shall we split to cover more ground?

TornadoHappy: Agreement. Disclosure pleasantries. Of company Splash Man preferential.

SplashHappy: Thank you. I am glad to be of assistance!

Narrator: We draw our attention back towards Hornet Man, Fakette, Jewel Woman and Magma Man..

%Hornet Man is moving his hands with increasing amounts of emotion while Fakette and Magma Man do much of the same. Jewel Woman stands there, her arms crossed and her lips pursed in annoyance.

FakeAnnoyed: I mean it's so obviously you! I don't see how we didn't realize it!

HornetGlare: I've told you already. It. Wasn't. Me.

FakeHappy: That's just what the perp would say!

%Jewel Woman strides out of the room, intent upon going to find Galaxy Man to set things straight and end the bickering.

HornetGlare: It. Was. Not. Me. At. All.

FakeAnnoyed: That's exactly what the perp would say~  Police dog! Sic 'em!

%Magma Man takes a moment to realize Fakette was speaking to him. He brings his arm up to point it at Hornet Man, however his eyes are locked on to Fakette.

MagmaAnnoyed: Private eye!

%Hornet Man, however, had enough. He angrily slammed his fist into the wall, denting the material underneath his furled fingers.

HornetPissed: FUCK YOU GUYS.

%Afterwards, he spins on his heel and starts to leave, however Fakette and Magma Man call after him.

FakeAnnoyed: Don't resist arrest!

%After hearing that, Hornet Man angrily stormed out of the room, with Fakette and Magma Man in hot pursuit. Meanwhile, in the living room, Jewel Woman was explaining the situation to Plug Man, who was seated upon the couch.

PlugShocked: Oh, mon dieu..

Jewel: ...Yes, and Hornet believed it to be Galaxy Man.

PlugShocked: Non non non! Galaxy and I were watching zis.

%Plug Man motions towards the television, which has a TV show about Pirate Ninjas on.

PlugHappy: Le programme is most enjoyable! Ah, but, in zis matter of Monsieur Concrete.. Monsieur Galaxy would not dare lay a fingeur upon him!

%Jewel Woman crosses her arms and draws her gaze to her foot, tapping it as she thought on his words.

Jewel: How long were you both watching the television for?

Plug: Ah! Since ze last time you spoke to moi!

JewelAnnoyed: ...You mean to tell me you both have been in here mindlessly watching television for a whole day?

PlugHappy: Oui.

%Jewel Woman shakes her head in disbelief, but deep down knows Plug's words are the truth.

Jewel: So, where is Galaxy right now?

PlugHappy: Monsieur Galaxy left five minutes ago to get snacks for moi! Around ze time of everyone's shouting!

Jewel: ...Good. When he returns, just.. ...continue to watch the television, I suppose. Remain on guard, however. We have no idea who did this to Concrete, nor how it was done.

Plug: Ah! All in ze room shall remain vigilant! You have nothing to worry about!

%Jewel Woman nods to Plug Man and exits the room, heading back to the place she'd last seen the others...

Narrator: Elsewhere, it would appear that Tornado Man and Splash Man had made significant headway in their investigation!

%Tornado Man appeared to have been standing before a large dumpster, one that was used to house the refuse of a recent remodeling. Splash Man, having returned to him after finding nothing of note, was listening intently to the detective as he explained how he had come to his conclusion in solving the case of Concrete Man's "death." 

Tornado: Note grime markings of trailmake in dirt grooves.

%Tornado Man bends forwards and leans down, pointing to a small spot nearest to the dumpster in which metal support beams, wood, and various other scraps had been piled up. Splash Man, in turn, leaned forwards as well, in order to get a better view of what Tornado Man was gesturing towards.

Tornado: Of pile make stand structure move inwards up dumpster. Into garbage trash trail make, go further to warrant investigate.

Splash: ...So the culprit escaped into the dumpster. Hmm. We'd best be on our guard!

%Tornado Man nods to Splash Man, and the two rather quickly make their way atop the pile which, in spite of its questionable composition, manages to hold their combined weight. Once they'd entered the dumpster, they managed to make note of a sudden rustling.

Tornado: Wait. Hearing noise make?

Splash: ...Yes.

Tornado: Cautionary of movements, slowly forward making.

%The two individuals slowly and cautiously advance upon a particular trembling pile of garbage. Upon Tornado Man's signal, Splash Man dives upon it, wrestling with the hellish creature that lay beneath the rubble -- a mettaur. Hissing, spitting and writhing in a futile attempt to break free, the mettaur spares Splash Man no quarter. However, despite its valiant attempt, it would be for naught. Splash Man, with a firm grip upon the mettaur, would turn and hold the creature up to Tornado Man.

Splash: ...It's merely a Mettaur.

TornadoHappy: Culprit in Concrete death hazard making found. Grime dirt upon appendage feet correlate with marking dirt inside near door and Concrete armor. Concrete head Mettaur. Lethargy and inattentiveness explain. Change drastic behavior make explain. Mental acuity loss explain.

SplashShocked: You mean to say that a Mettaur has been piloting the body of one of our comrades, right beneath our noses!?

%Tornado Man nods. He raises his hand, about to continue with his explanation, before he is cut off by a sudden, loud clamoring. Hornet Man is upon the roof, aiming his Hornet Chaser at the others, shouting obscenities. Magma Man has his arms raised, as if he were about to fire off a barrage in retaliation. Fakette stands behind Magma Man, her posture rigid as she points towards Hornet Man.

FakeAngry: SURRENDER! WE'VE GOT YOU.. ..SORT OF SURROUNDED!

HornetAngry: NO! FUCK OFF! I DIDN'T FUCKING DO THIS!

FakeAngry: Tell it to the judge! Book 'em!

%Magma Man turns to look back to Fakette, and the two begin to bicker about their roles in the investigation. Hornet Man, while they were distracted, allowed his gaze to dart about in order to search for the best possible escape route. Though his options were limited, he wasn't going to let that stop him from at least making an earnest attempt. Splash Man, below, made note of the skirmish atop the roof, and raised his free hand to cup against his face while he shouted up to them...

SplashAngry: Cease this foolishness! Nobody killed Concrete Man!

%Tornado Man draws his own gaze upwards, and shakes his head in disbelief. Of course the others would jump to such hasty conclusions. Tornado Man raises his voice and attempts to level with the group atop the roof.

TornadoAngry: Agreement. Finding Concrete remains found of dumpster creature.

%The others do not hear Splash Man and Tornado Man over their own yelling at one another. Tornado Man, with a sigh, cups his hands to either side of his lips and shouts loudly.

TornadoAngry: KNOWING OF CONCRETE MAN FATE! UN-BELIEVE MURDER!

%Tornado Man reaches for the squirming, hissing creature that Splash Man was wrestling with. He holds it up with one hand while his other hand remains at the side of his mouth.

TornadoAngry: BELIEF THAT CONCRETE IN HAND! 

%Tornado Man's words, however, are lost to the others, as Fakette's shouting prompted Magma Man to fire off a barrage at Hornet Man, who in an attempt to dodge, ends up plummeting to the ground below and landing within the very dumpster Tornado Man had pulled the Mettaur from.

MagmaShocked: OH!

FaketteShocked: Whoopsie! He should be fine if we just dust him off!

%The two could be seen descending back into the house. Tornado Man holds firmly the Mettaur while Splash Man attempts to rifle through the trash heap to retrieve Hornet Man. Upon finding the Hornet-based individual, a very familiar spattering of armor would catch his eye...

SplashShocked: Tornado, you need to see this!

%Tornado Man carefully manages to wade through the refuse pile to make his way over to the unconscious form of Hornet Man -- and the discarded metallic figure which Splash Man had uncovered in the process.

TornadoAngry: . . .Having explanation make, someone must.

%As Splash Man pulled Hornet Man up, both of the formerly unconscious individuals would regain consciousness..

PLACEHOLDERCONCRITTERHI: ...Uhn..

HornetAngry: Indiscriminate, quiet cursing.

%Splash Man looks down towards the Concrete-Man-esq individual, before hefting Hornet Man across his shoulder with one hand. With the other, he would hoist the much smaller, and far more lightweight entity across his other shoulder.

Tornado: Hmmm...

%Part one, end.
